# HUMSAFER Architecture (MVP)

- Frontend: static single-file HTML using Leaflet for maps.
- Backend: Express server with file-based JSON storage and a simple ledger simulating blockchain immutability.
- AI: simple heuristic script and a backend analyze endpoint for demonstration.
- IoT: small simulator to emit pings.

Next steps: authentication, secure KYC, real blockchain, push notifications, scalable DB, socket-based real-time updates.
